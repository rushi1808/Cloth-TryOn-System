- Conversational styling integrated throughout the experience

---

## 2. Core Features Breakdown

### 2.1 User Onboarding

#### Photo Upload
- Users can upload multiple photos (minimum 1, recommended 3-5)
- Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, HEIC
- Image requirements:
  - Full body or upper body shots
  - Clear visibility, good lighting
  - Neutral background preferred but not required
  - Face visible (for accurate try-on generation)
- Photo management:
  - Users can add/delete photos anytime
  - Mark one as "primary" (default for try-ons)
  - All photos stored and can be used for different try-on contexts

#### Optional Style Quiz (Skippable)
- 5-7 quick questions:
  - Body type preferences (how they'd describe their body)
  - Style preferences (casual, formal, streetwear, etc.)
  - Budget range
  - Favorite colors
  - Shopping frequency
  - Occasions they shop for
- Skip button prominent on every question
- Data used to seed initial recommendations if provided

#### Initial Profile Setup
- Basic info: Name, size preferences (S/M/L or numeric)
- Optional: Age range, location (for weather-appropriate suggestions)

---

### 2.2 Swipe Mode (Primary Discovery)

#### Card Generation Logic
- Generate 15 cards per batch
- First batch strategy (cold start):
  - If quiz completed: 60% based on quiz preferences, 40% diverse/exploratory
  - If quiz skipped: Equal distribution across style categories (casual, formal, streetwear, athleisure, etc.)
  - Use photo analysis for body type and visible style cues
- Subsequent batches:
  - Based on swipe history, chat interactions, feed engagement
  - 70% personalized, 30% exploratory (prevent filter bubble)

#### Card Content
- Virtual try-on image (user's photo + product)
- Product name
- Brand
- Price
- Retailer name
- Quick product details (color, material)
- "View Details" button (expands to full product page overlay)

#### Swipe Actions

**Swipe Right / Heart:** Save to "Likes" collection
- Triggers: Product saved, feeds learning algorithm
- Auto-generate related items in next batch

**Swipe Left / X:** Dislike
- Triggers: Item removed, negative signal to algorithm
- Track reason implicitly (color, style, price range analysis)

**Swipe Up / Star:** Super Like
- Triggers: Highest priority signal to algorithm
- May prompt: "What do you love about this?" (optional quick response)

**Tap Card:** View full details
- Overlay with:
  - Larger try-on image
  - Full product description
  - Size guide
  - Available sizes/colors
  - "Buy Now" button (affiliate link)
  - "Save to Collection" button
  - "Ask AI about this" button (opens chat with product context)

#### Left Swipe Intervention
- After 15 continuous left swipes:
  - Pause card stack
  - Show prompt: "Help me understand your style better"
  - Quick multi-choice questions:
    - What's not working? (too formal, too casual, wrong colors, budget too high, don't like the fit)
    - What would you prefer instead? (show style category options)
    - Budget preference? (slider)
  - "Reset and show new styles" button
  - Regenerate next 15 cards based on feedback

#### Card Prefetching/Generation
- Generate first 15 cards immediately on session start
- Start generating next batch when user reaches card 10
- Display loading state if generation isn't complete by card 15
- Cache try-on images for 7 days (if same product/photo combo requested again)

---

### 2.3 Collections (Liked Items)

#### Organization
- Default "Likes" collection (all right swipes)
- Users can create custom collections:

- Move/copy items between collections
- Each item shows:
  - Try-on image thumbnail
  - Product name, price
  - Date saved
  - Retailer
  - Availability status (in stock/out of stock)

#### Actions on Liked Items

---

### 6.3 AI/ML Services

**LLM for Chat:** Anthropic Claude API
- Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (best balance of speed/quality)

  "confidence": 0.85
}
```

**Algorithm:**
1. **Collaborative Filtering:** Similar users' likes
2. **Content-Based:** Similar to user's liked items
3. **Diversity Injection:** Exploratory items (30%)
4. **Trend Boosting:** Trending items get higher ranking
5. **Business Rules:** Filter out-of-stock, outside budget range

**Outputs:**

#### Feed Ranking
- Similar logic but different weights:
  - 40% personalized
  - 30% trending
  - 20% curated/editorial
  - 10% new arrivals
- Re-rank based on user's scroll behavior (impressions without engagement = negative signal)

#### Real-time Learning
